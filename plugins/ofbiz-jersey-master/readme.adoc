= JAX-RS (Jersey) Apache OFBizÂ® plugin

The Jersey plugin is one of the OFBiz plugins that provides a way to configure Jersey (JAX-RI) to allow developers to define their own REST APIs. It also integrates with Swagger-UI to generate API Docs. The plug-in comes with JWT Authentication enabled via javax.ws.rs.NameBinding (@Secured Annotation).

== OFBiz REST API based on JSR 339: JAX-RS 2.0
JAX-RS stands for Java API for RESTful Web Services and is a specification that provides support in creating web services according to the Representational State Transfer architectural pattern. 

=== Technical Documentation
The following section describes varios technical details pertaining to authentication, endpoint URLs and swagger documentation.

==== Important URLs
* API https://localhost:8443/api
* WADL https://localhost:8443/api/application.wadl
* Swagger UI https://localhost:8443/api/swagger/swagger-ui.html

==== Endpoints
The plug-in has three endpoints for demonstrating how to create new endpoints.

* GET /api/entities
* GET /api/entities/{name} 
* PUT /api/entities/import Accept: application/xml

==== Authentication
All three demo endpoints are secured. Authentication scheme is "Bearer <JWT>". Every request to the three API endpoints must have an Authorization header associated with it. 
Example -

GET /api/entities/AcctgTrans HTTP/1.1
